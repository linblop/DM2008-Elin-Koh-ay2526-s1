# Mini Project Updates
Press spacebar to initiate bird flap
If bird position is overlapping with pipe, it detects collision and game restarts
Added gameState variables and score system, so that it detects what to display (Start Screen/Game Over Screen) based on game play
Preload image for background 
Preload sound for background music, sound effects when jumping and game over screen
Sound plays when bird jumps & background sound loops
Adjusted pipe gap and flap strength
Adjusted pipe and bird colours to stand out from the background
